# Director Visualization

Quick data vis project. Making profiles of film directors using d3.js.

1. Extract data from imdb files. I couldn't find an API that met my needs, so I took the data out myself.
2. Have the basic d3 framwork ready.
3. Test actual data against prototype--start designing actual vis from there
